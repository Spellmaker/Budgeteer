# Budgeteer

Budgeteer is a small android app with the purpose of helping with monthly budgets.
The general aim is to be as simple as possible with quick access to the core functions:
Assigning expenses to categories and providing an overview as to how much money was spend per month
per category (and if its within budget).

This is also my first android jetpack project and as such uses way too complex jetpack libraries
for a very simple app in probably not quite the right way.
